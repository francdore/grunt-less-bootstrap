# Grunt, Less, Bootstrap Boilerplate

This is a clean Grunt build process which compiles LESS and Javascript

This repository can be used for a new responsive website. The following libraries are included:

* The latest Bootstrap CSS and Javascript
* An IE8 only stylesheet that can be included in your header
* Isotope (Documentation here: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/)

# To install

Just install git bash and then right click inside the folder when your grunt.js file is. Then run the command npm install which will install all of your packages specified in package.json

Then run the command "grunt". This will compile all of the bootstrap Less, Bootstaps Javascript, your custom Less that overrides the main Bootstrap styles and your Javascript file with your custom scripts.
