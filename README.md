# Grunt, Less, Bootstrap Project

This is a clean Grunt build process which compiles LESS and Javascript

# To install

Just install git bash and then right click inside the folder when your grunt.js file is. Then run the command npm install which will install all of your packages specified in package.json

Then run the command "grunt". This will compile all of the bootstrap Less, Bootstaps Javascript, your custom Less that overrides the main Bootstrap styles and your Javascript file with your custom scripts.
